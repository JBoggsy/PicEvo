<h1>Picture Evolver</h1>

<h4>Goals</h4>

The goal of PicEvo is to evolve a picture begin with random noise and ending at a simulacrum of a target picture.
 
<h4>Methods</h4>
The code creates a population of <em>n</em> Picture objects, which represent, as is obvious, a picture. A Picture is a grid of RandRGB pixels, which are not pixels in and of themselves but representations of possible pixels.
